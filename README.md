# T3BE-Transcriptions

This is a machine assisted transcription of T3BE questions from the Opening Arguments Podcast.

Questions 1-75 were transcribed by a machine from the audio podcast, then cleaned up by hand to contain just the T3BE question text.

Questions 76 onwards were transcribed by Optical Character Recognition from a screenshot of the question (provided to patrons of the podcast at patreon.com/law). And then also manually cleaned up.

The transcriptions may have errors associated with the automation involved. Questions 1-75 are unlikely to have misspellings, but may substitute homophones erroneously. Questions 76 onwards are more likely to have typos that look visually similar (for example, "attomey" rather than "attorney"). Make sure to verify the transcription is accurate before reusing.

"Allquestions.txt" has all the questions texts combined and is probably what you want to view/download. To download, click on the file so it opens in Github's file viewer, then click the "Download raw file" button in the top-right corner of the viewer. If you want a specific question by itself check out the "individualtxtfiles" folder.

If you just want to see questions since the reboot compiled together, look at "RebootQuestions.txt". If you just want to see the old run of questions complied together, look at "OldQuestions.txt"
